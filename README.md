# Will this execute my .NET Project?
Yes, it will. However, only a limited subset of .NET Features are working.

Set the DotNetParserRunner or TesterKernel project as the startup project in Visual Studio and click on Run.

# How to use?
## Basics
### Setting up
First you need to create an instance of `DotNetFile` and pass the byte array with the contents of your C# executable. Starting from some .NET core version, the EXE file was made into a stub which just runs `dotnet app.dll`. You need to use that dll file for it to work.
```csharp
var fl = new DotNetFile(@"c:\app.dll");
```
You can access all of the classes from the Types property in the ``fl`` variable.

Next, create an instance of ``DotNetClr``. This runs the .NET code.
```csharp
var clr = new DotNetClr(fl, @"c:\framework\");
```
`C:\framework` points to a folder where a basic corlib is made. You can find one under the releases.
### Executing
RegisterResolveCallBack is used to load dlls such as System.Private.Corlib. You can run the Start method to begin executing the code.
```csharp
clr.RegisterResolveCallBack(callback);
clr.Start();
```

Example of the callback:
```csharp
  private static byte[] AssemblyCallback(string dll)
        {
            if(dll == "System.Private.CoreLib")
            {
                return File.ReadAllBytes("framework/System.Private.CoreLib.dll");
            }
            else
            {
                return null;
            }
        }
```

## Marshaling
### Calling methods
#### "CLR" side
You can register an "internal" method which can be called from your application which you want to run.

```csharp
clr.RegisterCustomInternalMethod("TestsComplete", TestsComplete);
```

```csharp
private static void TestsComplete(MethodArgStack[] Stack, ref MethodArgStack returnValue, DotNetMethod method)
{
    Console.WriteLine("All Tests Completed.");
}
```
Inside of the function, the Stack variable represents all of the parameters. returnValue represents the return value of the internal method. Ignore it if the return type is void.

#### Application side
To invoke this newly created method, add this code:
```csharp
TestsComplete();

[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.InternalCall)]
public static extern void TestsComplete();
```
### Passing objects from the CLR to the application
#### "CLR" side
```csharp
 clr.RegisterCustomInternalMethod("TestsRxObject", TestRxObject);
 ```
 
 Now the method:
```csharp
private static void TestRxObject(MethodArgStack[] Stack, ref MethodArgStack returnValue, DotNetMethod method)
{
  var cctor = m.GetMethod("DotNetparserTester", "TestObject", ".ctor");
  if (cctor == null)
      throw new NullReferenceException();
  var s = new CustomList<MethodArgStack>();
  s.Add(MethodArgStack.String("value"));
  returnValue = clr.CreateObject(cctor, s);
}
```
First we get the constructor method (normally named `.ctor`). Then we build the list of parameters and call clr.CreateObject();
#### Application side
```csharp
  public class TestObject
    {
        public string TestProperty;

        public TestObject(string prop)
        {
            TestProperty = prop;
        }
    }
```
```csharp
[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.InternalCall)]
public static extern TestObject TestsRxObject();
```
```csharp
var m = TestsRxObject();
```
